(cl:in-package #:sicl-environment)

;;; This function differs from the standard Common Lisp function with
;;; the same name in that it has three required parameters.
;;;
;;; It is defined this way so that it can be executed by the host
;;; Common Lisp system early on during bootstrapping.
;;;
;;; It might seem that we could omit the CLIENT parameter, since it
;;; can be obtained from the global environment.  However, to get to
;;; the global environment, we can not call
;;; SICL-ENVIRONMENT:GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT, because that function is not
;;; defined outside the Clostrum environment.  And the reason for
;;; that, is that it must be a closure, closing over the environment
;;; in which it is defined.
;;;
;;; Now, SICL-ENVIRONMENT:GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT is defined to take an
;;; optional parameter, and if that optional parameter is supplied, it
;;; calls TRUCLER:GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT, so that is what we do here,
;;; since we always intend to supply an environment parameter.  But 
;;; TRUCLER:GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT requires a CLIENT parameter.
;;;
;;; The only way to avoid this circular dependency is to require a
;;; CLIENT parameter to SICL-ENVIRONMENT:GET-SETF-EXPANSION.  For
;;; consistency with Clostrum functions, we use the same order of the
;;; parameters as Clostrum does, i.e., CLIENT and ENVIRONMENT before
;;; any remaining parameters.

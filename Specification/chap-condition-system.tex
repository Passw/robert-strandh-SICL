\chapter{Condition system}

This module has been extracted to a separate repository named
Predicament.%
\footnote{https://github.com/robert-strandh/Predicament}
It is based on the portable condition system written by Micha≈Ç "phoe"
Herda.%
\footnote{https://github.com/phoe/portable-condition-system}
With permission from the author, we modified the code so that it could
be used as an intrinsic condition system in addition to the use as an
extrinsic system it was originally designed for.

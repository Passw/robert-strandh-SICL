\chapter{Pretty printer}

Richard C Waters designed the pretty printer for
\commonlisp{} (\cite{Waters89xp:a}, \cite{Waters:1992:UNC:1039991.1039996}).
It might seem a natural choice to use it for \sysname{}, but we found
that the quality of the code was unacceptably low for the standards of
\sysname{}.  As a result Tarn W. Burton created a completely new
library for pretty printing, call \inravina{}%
\footnote{https://github.com/s-expressionists/Inravina}.  \inravina{}
is perfectly integrated with \incless{}, described in
\refChap{chap-printer}.

\chapter{S-expression syntax}
\label{chap-s-expression-syntax}

This library is technically not part of the \sysname{} project.  It
was written by Jan Moringen independently.  It contains s-expression
level parsers for all standard special forms and all standard macros.
It uses the architecture.builder-protocol to communicate with a module
that creates the result of the parse.

We use it together with the Iconoclast library, described in
\refChap{chap-ast} which creates abstract syntax trees represented as
a graph of instances of standard classes.

The library can be found here:

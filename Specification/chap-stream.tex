\chapter{Streams}

We are using the Cyclosis library%
\footnote{https://github.com/s-expressionists/Cyclosis} for the
\commonlisp{} functions and classes related to streams.  This code was
extracted (with permission) from the Mezzano%
\footnote{https://github.com/froggey/Mezzano}
operating system.

Cyclosis also provides an implementation of Gray streams.

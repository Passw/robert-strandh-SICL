\chapter{Abstract syntax trees}
\label{chap-ast}

The Iconoclast library defines a large number of classes used to
represent abstract syntax trees, or ASTs.  We use this library as the
first compilation phase in that the s-expression-syntax library
described in \refChap{chap-s-expression-syntax} is invoked to parse
the source code and Iconoclast creates a graph of AST instances that
represents all aspects of the source code, including source positions
for each expression.

The library can be found here: https://github.com/robert-strandh/Iconoclast

\chapter{Calling conventions}

In this chapter, we describe the \sysname{} calling conventions that
are common for all native backends.  We describe only the
\emph{default} calling conventions, i.e., the calling conventions that
are applicable when an unknown callee is invoked.  The call-site
manager described in \refChap{chap-call-site-manager} will tailor the
calling conventions for each pair caller/callee when the callee is
known. 

We do not use callee-saves registers.  They complicate the calling
conventions, and especially the stack-traversal code of the garbage
collector.  And the default calling conventions do not use registers
to pass arguments.  Using the default calling conventions, the callee
must parse the arguments, and this task might involve looping over all
arguments to determine keyword arguments.  This task is simplified if
all arguments are passed on the stack.

\section{Normal call}

\subsection{Caller action before call}

The caller starts by setting up the callee stack frame as
shown in \refFig{fig-initial-callee-stack-frame}.

\begin{figure}

\inputfig{fig-initial-callee-stack-frame.pdf_t}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig-initial-callee-stack-frame}

\end{figure}

The callee stack frame does not evolve during the invocation of the
callee, or in other words, the stack frame set up by the caller
contains all the lexical variables that can not be kept in registers,
and for the duration of the invocation of the callee.

The slot marked ``unused'' in \refFig{fig-initial-callee-stack-frame}
is reserved for the return address, should the callee need to save it.
The callee frame pointer is set last, since the caller needs its frame
pointer to initialize every other slot, including the arguments.  The
size of the callee stack frame is taken from the callee function
object.  Arguments are in reverse order, i.e., the last argument is on
top of the stack.

Once the callee stack frame has been set up, the caller
executes an instruction that transfers control to the callee and saves
the return address.  On some backends, the return address is then
pushed on top of the stack.  On such backends, the callee pops the
return address and stores it in the slot marked ``unused'' in
\refFig{fig-initial-callee-stack-frame}.  On some backends, the return
address is saved in a register.  On such backends, the callee just
saves the contents of that register in the ``unused'' slot.

\subsection{Callee action to parse arguments}

The callee can determine the number of supplied arguments by using the
size of its stack frame (which is computed by the compiler), the frame
pointer, and the stack pointer.  It parses the arguments according to
its lambda list, and stores parameter values in registers or in the
stack frame.  It then removes the arguments from the top of the stack,
giving the situation shown in
\refFig{fig-callee-stack-frame-after-argument-parsing}.

\section{Processing return values}

When the callee returns, its stack frame is replaced by the return
values in reverse order.  The frame pointer of the caller has been
store in a register so that the caller can access it and restore its
frame pointer.

\subsection{Consumers of multiple values}

The following operators consume multiple values:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{multiple-value-call}
\item \texttt{multiple-value-bind}
\item \texttt{multiple-value-setq}
\item \texttt{multiple-value-list}
\item \texttt{setf} with \texttt{values}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\texttt{multiple-value-call}}

This operator can be seen as the most basic consumer of multiple
values.

\subsubsection{\texttt{multiple-value-bind}}

The standard says that

\begin{verbatim}
(multiple-value-bind ({var}*) values-form {form}*)
\end{verbatim}

is equivalent to

\begin{verbatim}
(multiple-value-call
    (lambda (&optional {var}* &rest #1=:ignore)
      (declare (ignore #1#))
      {form}*)
  values-form)
\end{verbatim}

Provided that a \texttt{\&rest} variable that is unused in the
function body is handled by not allocating a list of the remaining
arguments, this definition is not too bad.  Clearly,
\texttt{multiple-value-bind} must check the number of arguments, and
initialize optional parameters with \texttt{nil} when a corresponding
argument is omitted.  This is the same work as the anonymous function
in the second code snippet does.

\subsubsection{\texttt{multiple-value-setq}}

The standard says that

\begin{verbatim}
(multiple-value-setq ({symbol}*) values-form)
\end{verbatim}

Is defined to behave the same way as

\begin{verbatim}
(values (setf (values {symbol}*) values-form))
\end{verbatim}

where the outermost \texttt{values} is there to make sure that a
single value is returned, as the standard requires. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{multiple-value-list}}

The standard says that

\begin{verbatim}
(multiple-value-list values-form)
\end{verbatim}

is equivalent to

\begin{verbatim}
(multiple-value-call #'list values-form)
\end{verbatim}

It is very likely that allocating the \texttt{cons} cells that make up
the list will dominate over the use of the default calling convention,
so this equivalent form can be used without optimization. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{setf} with \texttt{values}}

According to the standard, \texttt{setf} with \texttt{values} binds
the variables ``as if by \texttt{multiple-value-bind}'', and this is
also a reasonable implementation.  Since \texttt{multiple-value-bind}
is defined in terms of \texttt{multiple-value-call}.  Therefore, all
operators that consume multiple values can be reduced to
\texttt{multiple-value-call}.

\chapter{Processing return values}

Multiple values can be produced only as a result of a function call.
With the default calling convention, a stack frame consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\item the frame pointer of the caller,
\item the call-site descriptor,
\item the return address (if saved), and
\item lexical variables required to accomplish the task.
\end{itemize}

The caller creates this stack frame for the callee.  Information about
the amount of space required for lexical variables is stored in the
function object, and accessed by the caller.

With the default calling convention, the caller stores the arguments
on top of the callee stack frame in reverse order.  The initial task
of the callee is then to parse the arguments and store the result in
lexical variables, either in registers or in the stack frame.  The
callee then removes the arguments from the stack.

When the callee returns, its stack frame is replaced by the return
values in reverse order.  The frame pointer of the caller has been
store in a register so that the caller can access it and restore its
frame pointer.
